{"name":"PR2 Robotic Hand and Syntouch Sensor Real-Time Interface","tagline":"Team 14","body":"### Authors\r\nCreated by Aaron Whitehead (@bigmacstorm), Brandon Salmon (@exiledz), Edward Miles (@elmiles93), and Shawn White (@smwhite). We are Team 14. Created for our senior project for CS 426 Software Engineering in Spring 2016 at the University of Nevada, Reno.\r\n\r\n### Advisor\r\nOur advisor for this project is Dave Fiel-Seifer from the Robot Research Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\nMany tasks that interact with the real world are still quite beyond the reach of humanoid computer systems. A robotic arm can just as easily crush a fragile object as it can let it slip from a weak grasp, with no knowledge of what went wrong or why. This project is designed around this limitation, and is based on the way humans overcome this hurdle. Humans are able to detect attributes of an object and adjust their grip as needed in a feedback loop, to ensure safe grip strength. By applying fingertip analog sensors to a robotic arm, a feedback loop can be developed to ensure that a computer can both hold and understand attributes of a fragile object. Beyond this scope, by applying the preceding ideals, this project will be able to test certain attributes of  a held object, such as heat, or heart rate of a human.\r\n\r\n#### Designer Templates\r\nOur program consists of several python plugins that are loaded into the ROS manager, which allow us to create different modules to perform different tasks, such as graphing data or moving a piece of the robot. Put together, this system can be seen as a suite of tools to be used with the PR2 in order to help facilitate our research into this field. Below you can see the main menu and a data graphing plugin both loaded and docked into the main client. Any button on the main menu that should access another plugin will load said plugin and also dock it inside of the client window.\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ANu7o3e.gif)\r\n\r\n### Project Related Resources\r\nlorem ipsum\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you need to contact any of the developers of this project for any reason please feel free to email any or all of us from our emails which can be found on our github profiles.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
