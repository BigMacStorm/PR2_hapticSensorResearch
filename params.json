{"name":"PR2 Robotic Hand and Syntouch Sensor Real-Time Interface","tagline":"Team 14","body":"### Project Description\r\nThis program is a suite of tools that utilizes the PR2 (and possibly other ROS capable robots) to measure haptic feedback and manipulate the physical parts of the robot in order to learn about the capabilities of a robot that is able to understand touch. Through this we plan to implement several different systems that will depend on haptic feedback loops, such as picking up a fragile or brittle object and move it to a different location, or detecting the pulse of a human by gently grabbing a users arm.\r\n\r\n#### Program Components\r\nOur program consists of several python plugins that are loaded into the ROS manager, which allow us to create different modules to perform different tasks, such as graphing data or moving a piece of the robot. Put together, this system can be seen as a suite of tools to be used with the PR2 in order to help facilitate our research into this field. Below you can see the main menu and a data graphing plugin both loaded and docked into the main client. Any button on the main menu that should access another plugin will load said plugin and also dock it inside of the client window.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ANu7o3e.gif)\r\n\r\n### Project Related Resources\r\nlorem ipsum\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nCreated by Aaron Whitehead (@bigmacstorm), Brandon Salmon (@exiledz), Edward Miles (@elmiles93), and Shawn White (@smwhite).
