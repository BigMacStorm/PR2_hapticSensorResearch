{"name":"PR2 Robotic Hand and Syntouch Sensor Real-Time Interface","tagline":"Team 14","body":"\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ANu7o3e.gif)\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\nThis program is a suite of tools that utilizes the PR2 (and possibly other ROS capable robots) to measure haptic feedback and manipulate the physical parts of the robot in order to learn about the capabilities of a robot that is able to understand touch. Through this we plan to implement several different systems that will depend on haptic feedback loops, such as picking up a fragile or brittle object and move it to a different location, or detecting the pulse of a human by gently grabbing a users arm. \r\nOur program consists of several python plugins that are loaded into the ROS manager, which allow us to create different modules to perform different tasks, such as graphing data or moving a piece of the robot. Below you can see the main menu and a data graphing plugin both loaded and docked into the main client. Any button on the main menu that should access another plugin will load said plugin and also dock it inside of the client window.\r\n\r\n### Project Related Resources\r\n**Install BioTacs in ROS.**\r\n\r\n<http://bolt-haptics.seas.upenn.edu/index.php/Software/InstallingBioTacs>\r\nThe bolt haptics repository is a repository created and used by UPenn researchers with work done for the PR2 and syntouch sensors; the goals of the repository are very similar to the goals of this senior project. \r\n\r\n**BioTacÂ® Product Manual.**\r\n\r\n<http://www.syntouchllc.com/Products/BioTac/_media/BioTac_Product_Manual.pdf>\r\n\r\nThis is simply the product/user manual for the Syntouch BioTac sensors. It provides product care and maintenance information. The manual also includes information about the built in sensors including sensor outputs and a circuit diagram, It also has all command types and samples of how to use them. \r\n\r\n**PR2 Hardware Specs.**\r\n\r\n<https://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/specs>\r\n\r\nThis website has the hardware specifications for the PR2. It lists out all of the parts used in the PR2 and has diagrams to show where they are on the PR2. \r\n\r\n**PR2 Ros Wiki.**\r\n\r\n<http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/PR2>\r\n\r\nThis website is a user-contributed to Wiki site for the Robot Operating System (ROS), and specifically its usage by the PR2 robot. It provides a large amount of information regarding design and implementation for ROS systems, and was an essential resource in the design/limitations of this interface. \r\n\r\n**PR2 User Manual.**\r\n\r\n<https://pr2s.clearpathrobotics.com/wiki/PR2%20Manual>\r\n\r\nThe site is the user manual for the PR2 robot. It provides information on everything you need to know about the PR2. It provides safety overviews, design features, and how to install the software needed to get started. It also has all the information about all of the moving parts of the robot. \r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nCreated by Aaron Whitehead (@bigmacstorm), Brandon Salmon (@exiledz), Edward Miles (@elmiles93), and Shawn White (@smwhite).
