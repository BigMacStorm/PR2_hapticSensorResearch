1. Use a linux operating system to install ROS (I used ubuntu 15.04 in vmware). If you want to do the same, you can follow the instructions here to install ROS jade: http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu.

2. Open up roscore by typing "roscore &" in terminal.

3. Test rqt by opening it using "rqt" in terminal.

4. add the current working directory to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH enviornment variable by running the following command from the git directory.
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)"

5. You should now be able to run the program by running the following command.
rqt --standalone rqt_pr2_hand_syntouch_sensor_interface

6. Write plugins for rqt that implement our interface in either C++ or python. See http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20C%2B%2B%20Plugin for C++ or http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20Python%20Plugin for python.
